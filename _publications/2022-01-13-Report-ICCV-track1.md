Abstract:
------
This report introduces our solution for the ICCV 2021 Workshop SSLAD Track 1-2D Object Detection. The goal of Semi-Supervised Object Detection (SS-OD) is to train a detector that exploits large amounts of unlabeled data with only a few data labeled. Till now, related methods can be roughly divided into self-training based methods and consistency-regularization based methods. In this work, we combined the above mentioned methods and proposed a holistic framework named O2O (Offline to Online) for the SS-OD problem. We adopted Cascade R-CNN with the Swin-Transformer backbone as our detector for training on the SODA10M dataset. In virtue of the proposed SS-OD method, our best single model could reach an mAP of 81.35. With ensembles, we further improved the final mAP in the public leaderboard to 81.79 and achieved 2nd place in the SSLAD Track 1 challenge.
