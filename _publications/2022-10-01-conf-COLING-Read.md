Abstract:
------
The introduction of multimodal information and pretraining technique significantly improves entity recognition from visually-rich documents. However, most of the existing methods pay unnecessary attention to irrelevant regions of the current document while ignoring the potentially valuable information in related documents. To deal with this problem, this work proposes a cross-document semantic enhancement method, which consists of two modules: 1) To prevent distractions from irrelevant regions in the current document, we design a learnable attention mask mechanism, which is used to adaptively filter redundant information in the current document. 2) To further enrich the entity-related context, we propose a cross-document information awareness technique, which enables the model to collect more evidence across documents to assist in prediction. The experimental results on two documents understanding benchmarks covering eight languages demonstrate that our method outperforms the SOTA methods.
