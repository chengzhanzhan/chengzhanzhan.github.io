Abstract:
------
Scene video text spotting (SVTS) is a very important research topic because of many real-life applications. However, only a little effort has been put to spotting scene video text, in contrast to massive studies of scene text spotting in static images. Due to various environmental interferences like motion blur, spotting scene video text becomes very challenging. To promote this research area, this competition introduces a new challenge dataset containing 129 video clips from 21 natural scenarios in full annotations. The competition contains three tasks, that is, video text detection (Task 1), video text tracking (Task 2) and end-to-end video text spotting (Task3). During the competition period (opened on 1st March, 2021 and closed on 11th April, 2021), a total of 24 teams participated in the three proposed tasks with 46 valid submissions, respectively. This paper includes dataset descriptions, task definitions, evaluation protocols and results summaries of the ICDAR 2021 on SVTS competition. Thanks to the healthy number of teams as well as submissions, we consider that the SVTS competition has been successfully held, drawing much attention from the community and promoting the field research and its development.
