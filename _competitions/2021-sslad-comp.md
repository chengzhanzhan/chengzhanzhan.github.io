Autonomous driving technology has been significantly accelerated in recent years because of its great potential in reducing accidents, saving human lives and improving efficiency. In this competition, we focus on continul learning for object detection on four different scenes sequentially.

SODA10M is a 2D object detection dataset, which contains images captured from four different scenarios. These scenarios are set as four tasks for continual learning. The continual learner is trained on each task sequentially. 

- Task 1: Daytime, citystreet and clear weather. There are 4470 images in the training set.
- Task 2: Daytime, highway and clear/overcast weather. There are 1329 images in the training set.
- Tast 3: Night. There are 1479 images in the training set.
- Tast 4: Daytime, rain. There are 524 images in the training set.
