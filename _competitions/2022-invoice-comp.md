Invoice recognition is a very important part of financial office automation, which aims to automatically extract predetermined content (such as date and amount) from scanned invoices. Due to the problems of various layouts, blurred handwriting, and misplaced text in scanned tickets, it is a very challenging task to accurately locate, identify and structure the fields of the invoices.

This time we released the invoice analysis and identification challenge. This competition is related to cutting-edge technologies such as computer vision, natural language processing, and multimodal fusion, and has great technical value and practical social application value. We sincerely invite the vast number of algorithm experts and technology enthusiasts to participate, to design better invoice recognition algorithms, and to further promote the implementation of OCR in real production scenarios.
