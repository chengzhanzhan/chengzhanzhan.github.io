This is a challenge on scene text detection and recognition, based on the largest scene text dataset currently available, based on real (as opposed to synthetic) scene imagery: the COCO-Text dataset. It is structured around three tasks: Text Localization, Cropped Word Recognition and End-To-End Recognition.

Cropped Word Recognition, where the locations (bounding boxes) of words in the image are assumed to be known and the corresponding text transcriptions are sought.
