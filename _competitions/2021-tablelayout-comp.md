Task A
------
This competition aims to advance the research in recognizing the layout of unstructured documents. Participants of this competition need to develop a model that can identify the common layout elements in document images, including text, titles, tables, figures, and lists, with confidence score for each detection.

We have won the 1st place out of 80 teams in this timed challenge!

Task B
------
Participants of this competition need to develop a model that can convert images of tabular data into the corresponding HTML code. The targeted HTML code should correctly represent the structure of the table and the content of each cell. HTML tags that define the font style including bold, italic, strike through, superscript, and subscript should be included in cell content. The HTML code does NOT need to reconstruct the appearance of tables such as border lines, background color, font, font size, or font color. The figure below illustrates an example table image and its targeted HTML code. Note that the targeted HTML code does not contain the settings about border lines, background color of the header row, or the blue font color of 'Woof'.

We have won the 1st place out of 30 teams in this timed challenge!
