Scene video text spotting (SVTS) is a text spotting system of localizing and recognizing text from continuous video frames, which usually contains multiple modules: video text detection, text tracking and the final recognition. It is an important research topic, because many real-world applications work in video mode such as license plate recognition in intelligent transportation system, road sign recognition in advanced driver assistance system or even online handwritten character recognition.

With the rapid development of deep learning techniques, great progress has been made in scene text spotting in static images. However, spotting text from video frames has much higher robustness requirements than the static OCR tasks for many applications. That is, SVTS will become much challenging when facing various environmental interferences (e.g., camera shaking, motion blur and immediate illumination changing etc.) as well as the real-time response requirement. Therefore, it is necessary to research efficient and robust SVTS systems to meet amount of practical application requirements.

SVTS 2021 competition will provide 129 video clips from 21 real-life scenarios. By establishing such a large-scale dataset with diversified scenarios, we hope more inspiring works can be proposed to solve this issue which has very promising applicational prospect.
